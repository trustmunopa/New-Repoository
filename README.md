**The Github Assignment**
✅ Commit
A commit is a snapshot of changes you've made to files and folders in your project. It records modifications like file edits, renames, creations, or deletions. Commits live in branches and allow you to track the history of your project. Think of it as saying: "I made these changes, and I’m saving them here."

✅ Pull Request
A pull request (PR) is how you propose changes from one branch to be added to another (usually to the main branch). It’s where collaboration and code review happen — others can review, comment, approve, or suggest edits before changes are merged.

✅ Merge
To merge means to take the changes from one branch (like from a pull request) and integrate them into another branch (commonly the main branch). Once a pull request is approved, merging brings your new changes into the project.

✅ Branch
A branch is an independent version of your project that lets you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project. The main branch is the default, stable version. Creating a branch allows you to experiment safely and later merge your work back when it's ready.

✅ Fetch
Fetch gets the latest changes from the remote repository (like GitHub) to your local machine — but it doesn’t apply them yet. It’s like checking for updates, without changing your current files.

✅ Push
To push is to upload your local commits (changes) to the remote repository on GitHub. Once you’ve committed locally, pushing sends those commits to be stored and shared with others on the online repo.

✅ Fork
Forking a repository creates your own copy of someone else’s project under your GitHub account. This lets you make changes freely without affecting the original. It’s commonly used to propose changes to other people’s projects or to use them as a starting point for your own idea.

✅ Clone
Cloning is the process of downloading a GitHub repository to your local computer so you can work on it directly. After you clone a repo, you can edit files, make commits, and push changes back to GitHub.
